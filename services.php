                At Our Institute we teach a style of Martial Arts called Kyokushin. 
                Kyokushin is a style of stand-up fighting and was founded in 1964 by Korean-Japanese Masutatsu Oyama.
                "Kyokushin" is Japanese for "the ultimate truth". It is rooted in a philosophy of self-improvement, discipline
                and hard training. Its full contact style has international appeal.
